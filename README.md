## Overview

The [dWeb Protocol Suite](https://dwebx.org) is a peer-to-peer network for sharing files and data. This command-line provides a convenient set of tools for accessing the network.

There are two common kinds of "dDatabases":

- **dDrive** A folder containing files.
- **dWebTree** A key-value database (similar to leveldb).

All data has a URL which starts with `dweb://`. A URL will look like this:

```
dweb://515bbbc1db2139ef27b6c45dfa418c8be6a1dec16823ea7cb9e61af8d060049e/
```

You use these URLs to access the dweb data over the peer-to-peer network. For example:

```
dweb ls dweb://515bbbc1db2139ef27b6c45dfa418c8be6a1dec16823ea7cb9e61af8d060049e/
dweb cat dweb://515bbbc1db2139ef27b6c45dfa418c8be6a1dec16823ea7cb9e61af8d060049e/file.txt
cat diagram.png | dweb put 515bbbc1db2139ef27b6c45dfa418c8be6a1dec16823ea7cb9e61af8d060049e/diagram.png
```

You can create a new ddrive or dwebtree using the `create` commands:

```
dweb create drive
```

You can then seed the hyper (or seed a hyper created by somebody else) using the `seed` command:

```
dweb seed dweb://515bbbc1db2139ef27b6c45dfa418c8be6a1dec16823ea7cb9e61af8d060049e/
```

To see what hubs you are currently seeding, run `info`:

```
dweb info
```
